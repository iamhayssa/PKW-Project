# Hi! 

The PKW Project is my first attempt to learn how to use python for data analysis. The project is based on an official dataset of the fleet of PKWs (Personenkraftwagen or, in English, passenger cars) per automaker in Germany between 01.01.2016 and 01.01.2020 from the Kfz - und Anh√§ngerbestandes (KBA), the German federal authority responsible for motor vehicles. As a newbie, I am open to comments and suggestions! Feel free to send me a message :D
